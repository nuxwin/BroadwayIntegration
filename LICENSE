License Agreement for Software Products of i-MSCP (internet - Multi Server Control Panel) project team

§ 1 Rights of Use
(1) In return for the payment of the agreed lump sum remuneration, i-MSCP grants its Customers a non-exclusive, limited right to use the Software for an unlimited period of time. The right of use of the acquired Software is limited to one installation on a single i-MSCP instance. This does not apply if Customers have acquired from i-MSCP a "Extension"-license, which allows Customers to install and use the acquired Software on multiple i-MSCP instances.
(2) The acquired Software is licensed exclusively to the Customer mentioned in the Customer Account and may be used according to paragraph 1 above only by this Customer.
(3) If customers intend to run multiple installations of the Software, the right of use must be extended accordingly, that is, Customers need to acquire one or, if needed, several copies of the i-MSCP's software. Any use beyond the contractual agreement constitutes a breach of contract. In this case the Customer is required to inform i-MSCP about the use in excess of the license.
(4) Customers are entitled to make a security backup of the Software and to conduct daily data storage. The creation of any further copies other than security backup and data storage is prohibited.
(5) Customers are not entitled to de-compile, amend or change the Software unless this is permitted by law, i.e. in case such de-compilation, amendment or change is necessary to create an interface for other software applications or to eliminate malfunctions in the Software. Customers may change, amend or process the source code of the Software as well as the data base structure of the Software at their own risk. Customers are also entitled to adjust the software in terms of graphics and functions to their own needs.
(6) Copyright markers as well as other notes identifying software or source code may not be removed or amended. They are to be transferred to each copy of the Software. This does not apply if Customers have acquired from i-MSCP a "Branding Free"-license, which allows Customers to remove the respective copyright markers as well as other notes identifying software- or source code.

§ 2 Updates
(1) i-MSCP provides Software updates in irregular intervals. Customers may install the respective update at their own discretion.
(2) Customers must apply the offered updates in order to benefit from stability and feature enhancements.

§ 3 Transfer
(1) The Software copy may only be transferred as a whole, i.e. by discontinuing the use of the acquired Software copy, Customers may transfer its respective right to use the Software according to the license agreement between i-MSCP and the Customer to a third party. In this case the Customer must delete the Software on the Customer’s own remaining data carriers. After transfer the Customer’s right to use the Software ceases to exist.
(2) Customers may not transfer the Software to third parties if there is a reasonable suspicion that the third party intends to breach the existing license provisions, particularly if the third party intends to create illegal copies.

$ 4 Limitation of liability
(1) i-MSCP assumes no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from possession, access, use or malfunction of the software, including but not limited to, damages to property, loss of goodwill, computer/mobile device failure or malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or punitive damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to this agreement or the software, whether arising in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not i-MSCP has been advised of the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for death, personal injury, fraudulent misrepresentations or certain intentional or negligent acts, or violation of specific statutes, or the limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation of liability may not apply to you. In no event shall i-MSCP's total liability to you for all damages (except as may be required under applicable law) exceed the amount paid by you for the software.
